# Mapping of variable names used in the VBA scripts of input_viewer.xlsm to those used in the python code / input data.
# This helps with renaming variables / data columns, as they don't have to be changed in the VBA scripts, but only here, where they are searchable outside of Excel.
# Strict format: No quotes! key and value separated with three colons, one pair per line. Comments must have "#" as first ccharacter of line (no in-line comments); no empty line at end of file.
