# Introduction

CaCoCa (The Carbon Contracts Calculator) is a tool to model carbon contracts for difference (CCfDs) for industrial decarbonization projects. Abatement cost time curves can be calculated, and auctions of such carbon contracts (where the projects bidding the lowest carbon price are awarded contracts) can be modeled.
