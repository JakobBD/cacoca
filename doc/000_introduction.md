# Introduction

CaCoCa (The Carbon Contracts Calculator) is a tool to model carbon contracts for difference (CCfDs) for industrial decarbonization projects. Abatement cost time curves can be calculated, and auctions of such carbon contracts (where the projects bidding the lowest carbon price are awarded contracts) can be modeled.

While most of the code can be used for general CCfDs, some parts are specifically based on the tender design of the German industry CCfDs introduced in 2023. Further information can be found [here](https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Artikel/Klimaschutz/klimaschutzvertraege.html).

The techno-economic input data provided in this repository is incomplete and not to be relied upon. It only serves as an example for the functionality of the code. It is advised to use your own data.

Please have a look at the open [issues](https://github.com/JakobBD/cacoca/issues) for some further limitations.
